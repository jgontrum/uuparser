expressed the wish that librarians become more fluent in DH .\": \"6\", \"A year later , the National Library of the Netherlands ( Koninklijke Bibliotheek ) , and the University Library of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam again concluded that librarians at their institutes who wanted to get involved in DH needed more training to adequately support researchers and students in this field .\":

see this as the ideal opportunity to provide these educative sessions not only to our own librarians , but also to the academic librarians of other Dutch research libraries .\": \"10\", \"In essence ,

partner needed in DH projects .\": \"11\", \"The aim of these clinics is to provide basic methodological competencies and technical skills in DH , for a diverse group of librarians , consisting of both subject and technical librarians with basic technical skills .\": \"12\", \"The content of these sessions should enable them to provide services to researchers and students , identify remaining gaps in knowledge or skills that they could address by self-directed learning and ( perhaps ) to automate their daily library work .\": \"13\", \"We are not setting out to turn them into programmers
